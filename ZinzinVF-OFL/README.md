The **Zinzin VF** is a variable OpenType test font based on [Cinzel and Cinzel Decorative](http://ndiscovered.com/cinzel/). 

The font has a `SWSH` axis which conditionally enables 350 lookups as the axis value progresses. The lookups gradually replace uppercase letters with swash variants, and lowercase letters with larger caps. It has an empty `gvar` table as it does not do any glyph variation, just feature variation. 

The font is for **test purposes**.
