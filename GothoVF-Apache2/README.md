# Variable OpenType test fonts

## Gotho (Apache 2)

The **Gotho** is an OpenType font family based on [Roboto](https://github.com/google/roboto/), subsetted to some 1160+ glyphs covering the Latin alphabet. Compared with Roboto, it includes a **wider range of widths**. 

Some glyphs were redesigned, most notably the "l". 

The variable OpenType font Gotho VF will be prepared later.
